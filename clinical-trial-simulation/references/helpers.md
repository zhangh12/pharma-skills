# TrialSimulator-Provided Functions: A Catalog

When TrialSimulator provides a function, **use it** instead of base R
equivalents or external packages. This catalog is what the package
gives you. Reach for these reflexively.

For full argument lists, consult `?<function>` in R or
https://zhangh12.github.io/TrialSimulator/reference/.

## Enroller

`StaggeredRecruiter` is the only enroller this skill uses. It is **for
`trial(enroller = ...)` only — never as an `endpoint(generator = ...)`**.

| Function | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `StaggeredRecruiter(n, accrual_rate)` | Piecewise-constant-rate accrual. `accrual_rate` is `data.frame(end_time, piecewise_rate)`. Pass via `trial(..., enroller = StaggeredRecruiter, accrual_rate = <data.frame>)`. |

Tip — **simulating a recruitment pause** (e.g., a hold for safety
review after an interim): use a near-zero `piecewise_rate` for the
relevant time window. The schedule still has full coverage; the rate
is just very low during the pause.

```r
accrual_rate <- data.frame(
  end_time       = c(12, 18, Inf),
  piecewise_rate = c(30, 0.001, 30)   # 12 mo at 30/mo, 6 mo near-pause, then 30/mo
)
```

## RNGs / endpoint generators

Use these inside `endpoint(generator = ...)`.

### endpoint() grouping rule

Each `endpoint()` call defines **one set of endpoints generated
together by a single generator function**. Endpoints across
**separate** `endpoint()` calls are independent — the package
invokes each set's generator independently.

Two orthogonal decisions:

- **How many endpoints per `endpoint()` call?** This is determined by
  how endpoints group into independent vs. correlated sets. Endpoints
  that need to be correlated must share one `endpoint()` call;
  endpoints that are independent of each other can be split across
  separate calls.
- **Which generator to use?**
  - If a call defines exactly **one** endpoint, the generator can be
    a simple base-R RNG (`rexp`, `rnorm`, `rbinom`, ...) or a custom
    function.
  - If a call defines **two or more** endpoints together, the
    generator MUST be a custom (or built-in) joint generator returning
    a `data.frame` with one column per endpoint (plus `<name>_event`
    columns for TTE endpoints). Base-R RNGs only emit one variable,
    so they cannot be used for multi-endpoint calls.

> **Custom data models — always on the table.** Whenever the user
> has their own data model (a specific distribution, mechanistic
> model, empirical resampling, a custom copula, NORTA, anything),
> help implement it as a custom generator. Base-R RNGs and built-in
> joint generators are convenient defaults, not the only options.
> The contract: `function(n, ...)` returning a `data.frame` with one
> column per endpoint name (plus `<name>_event` columns for TTE).
> First argument must be `n` — wrap if it isn't (e.g., `base::sample`
> uses `x`). See `?endpoint` and `building_blocks.md` for details.

Examples:

- PFS and OS, modeled as independent → two `endpoint()` calls, each
  with `rexp`.
- PFS and OS, modeled as correlated → one `endpoint()` call with
  `CorrelatedPfsAndOs2` (or a custom joint generator).
- PFS+OS correlated, plus three biomarkers correlated among
  themselves but independent of PFS/OS → one `endpoint()` call for
  {pfs, os} with a joint generator, and another `endpoint()` call for
  the three biomarkers with a different joint generator.

### TTE — piecewise / non-PH

| Function | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `PiecewiseConstantExponentialRNG(n, risk, endpoint_name)` | TTE with piecewise-constant hazard. `risk` is `data.frame(end_time, piecewise_risk[, hazard_ratio])`. Use for delayed treatment effects, non-PH scenarios, or any user input expressed as "hazard rate from time A to time B." |

### TTE — correlated PFS + OS (and response)

> **Names are not the model.** The `pfs_name` / `os_name` arguments
> (and `death_name` / `progression_name` / `response_name` for
> `CorrelatedPfsAndOs4`) rename the output columns. The generators
> are structurally about a "shorter, possibly-progressive event"
> bounded above by a "longer, absorbing event" — recognize this
> pattern wherever it appears, not only oncology PFS/OS. Examples:
> time-to-relapse vs. time-to-death (hematology), time-to-MACE vs.
> time-to-all-cause mortality (CV), time-to-disability-progression
> vs. time-to-death (neurology), time-to-first-event vs.
> time-to-fatal-event in any composite-endpoint trial. If the user's
> endpoint pair has the structural PFS ≤ OS relationship, these
> generators apply with renamed columns.

In oncology, PFS and OS are commonly modeled together. **First ask
whether the user wants the correlation modeled explicitly.**

- **Don't model correlation** → two separate `endpoint()` calls. The
  distribution for each (`rexp`, `rweibull`, `PiecewiseConstantExponentialRNG`,
  or a custom function) is the user's call — offer the options.
- **Gumbel copula** (`CorrelatedPfsAndOs2`) → joins latent TTP and OS
  via a Gumbel copula, defining PFS = min(TTP, OS) so PFS ≤ OS by
  construction. Both marginals stay exponential, so the hazard ratio
  between arms is constant — **right choice when Cox PH is the
  planned analysis**. Log-rank also works (it does not require PH).
  User provides median PFS, median OS, Kendall's tau. No solver.
- **Illness-death model** (`CorrelatedPfsAndOs3`) → three-state
  Markov model (stable → progression → death, stable → death
  directly). Induces a **time-varying OS hazard ratio between arms**
  → **incompatible with Cox PH** (HR estimate stops being meaningful).
  Log-rank is still valid (no PH assumption) but may lose power
  against the time-varying alternative; parametric or mechanistic
  analyses are alternatives. Hazards are non-intuitive — derive from
  medians + Pearson correlation via `solveThreeStateModel()` (see
  "Parameter solvers") and hardcode the literals.
- **Custom joint generator** — single multi-endpoint `endpoint()`
  call, generator returns a `data.frame` with `pfs`, `pfs_event`,
  `os`, `os_event`. Use whenever the user has a specific data model
  in mind (a different copula, NORTA, mechanistic, empirical, ...).

| Function | Inputs | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `CorrelatedPfsAndOs2(n, median_pfs, median_os, kendall, pfs_name, os_name)` | medians + Kendall's tau | PH-compatible |
| `CorrelatedPfsAndOs3(n, h01, h02, h12, pfs_name, os_name)` | three transition hazards | NOT PH-compatible |
| `CorrelatedPfsAndOs4(n, transition_probability, duration, death_name, progression_name, response_name)` | 4×4 transition matrix + duration | Adds objective response as a 4th state. Response is returned as TTE — wrap to convert to binary at a readout time if needed. |

Base R `rexp`, `rnorm`, `rbinom`, `rweibull` etc. are fine for
single-distribution generators — TrialSimulator examples use them
directly. The "prefer TS" rule is about specialized cases (piecewise
hazards, correlated PFS/OS, parameter conversion) where TS provides
something base R doesn't.

## Quantile / distribution support

| Function | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `qPiecewiseExponential(p, times, piecewise_risk)` | Quantile of piecewise exponential. Reach for it when building a NORTA or copula construction with a piecewise-exponential marginal — `simdata::simdesign_norta` needs a `function(p)` per marginal. For an *independent* piecewise-exponential endpoint, use `PiecewiseConstantExponentialRNG` directly instead. |

---

## Parameter solvers

These convert clinically interpretable inputs into the parameters the
generators need.

> **Two-step rule.** Any solver that does numerical search
> (`solveThreeStateModel`, and `simdata::simdesign_norta` for NORTA
> setups) is slow. **Run it ONCE in a separate `Rscript` step**,
> capture the chosen literals, show them to the user, and **hardcode
> them** in the simulation script. The simulation script must never
> re-run an optimizer per replicate.

| Function | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `solveThreeStateModel(median_pfs, median_os, corr, h12)` | Convert (median PFS, median OS, target Pearson correlation) → `(h01, h02, h12)` for `CorrelatedPfsAndOs3`. Grid search over `h12`; pick the row with smallest `error`. |
| `solveMixtureExponentialDistribution(weight1, median1, median2, overall_median)` | Two-component exponential mixture: solve for the missing piece. Specify exactly one of `median2` or `overall_median`; the other is returned. Use for enrichment-design subgroup medians. |
| `solvePiecewiseConstantExponentialDistribution(surv_prob, times)` | Convert (survival probabilities at landmark times) → `data.frame(end_time, piecewise_risk)` ready for `PiecewiseConstantExponentialRNG`. Reach for it when the user gives "75% at 12 months, 50% at 24 months." |
| `weibullDropout(time, dropout_rate)` | Convert (dropout rates at two landmarks) → `c(scale, shape)` for `rweibull`. For a single landmark, use `dropout = rexp, rate = -log(1-p)/t` directly — no solver needed. |

### Decision table — given user input, which solver?

| User says | Use |
|---|---|
| Medians + Kendall's tau, Cox/LR planned | `CorrelatedPfsAndOs2` directly (no solver) |
| Medians + Pearson correlation, non-Cox analysis | `solveThreeStateModel` → `CorrelatedPfsAndOs3` (hardcode literals) |
| Survival probability at K landmarks | `solvePiecewiseConstantExponentialDistribution` → `PiecewiseConstantExponentialRNG` |
| Marker subgroup medians + overall median (or vice versa) | `solveMixtureExponentialDistribution` → custom mixture generator |
| Dropout at 2 landmarks | `weibullDropout` → `dropout = rweibull, scale, shape` |
| Dropout at 1 landmark | exponential is the simple default: `dropout = rexp, rate = -log(1-p)/t`. If the user has a different model in mind (e.g., heavier early dropout, time-varying), build a custom dropout function whose first argument is `n` and pass it as `trial(dropout = my_fn, ...)`. |
| Constant uniform accrual | none — `accrual_rate = data.frame(end_time = Inf, piecewise_rate = N)` |
| Ramp-up accrual | none — multi-row `accrual_rate` |
| Recruitment pause window | none — set `piecewise_rate` near zero for the pause window |

## Analysis / model fitting

Standardized one-sided wrappers. Each returns a `data.frame` with one
row per experimental arm × placebo pair, with columns `arm`,
`placebo`, `estimate`, `p`, `z`, `info` (some omit `estimate`). The
`...` argument accepts `dplyr::filter` syntax for subsetting (e.g.,
`biomarker == "positive"`).

Use these inside action functions. **Prefer them over hand-rolled
`coxph`/`survdiff`/`glm`/`lm` calls** — the standardized output makes
downstream `trial$save()` clean.

| Function | Method | Covariate adjustment | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `fitCoxph(formula, placebo, data, alternative, scale, ...)` | Cox PH | yes | `scale = "hazard ratio"` or `"log hazard ratio"` — no default; specify explicitly. `formula` is `Surv(time, event) ~ arm [+ covars + strata(...)]`. |
| `fitLogrank(formula, placebo, data, alternative, ...)` | log-rank | no, but supports `strata(...)` | Same `Surv(...)` formula. |
| `fitLogistic(formula, placebo, data, alternative, scale, ...)` | logistic regression | yes | `scale = "coefficient" \| "odds ratio" \| "risk ratio" \| "risk difference"` — no default; specify explicitly. |
| `fitLinear(formula, placebo, data, alternative, ...)` | linear model (ATE via `emmeans`) | yes | |
| `fitFarringtonManning(endpoint, placebo, data, alternative, ...)` | rate-difference test for binary | no | `endpoint` is a column name string, not a formula. |

`alternative` is `"greater"` or `"less"` — one-sided is enforced.

> **Get `alternative` right — it determines whether the simulation
> answers the right question.** The direction of "treatment is
> better" depends on the endpoint:
> - TTE (PFS, OS, time to event): treatment is better when its
>   hazard is lower → `alternative = "less"` for `fitCoxph` /
>   `fitLogrank`.
> - Response rate / risk difference / odds ratio: treatment is
>   typically better when higher → `alternative = "greater"` for
>   `fitLogistic`, `fitFarringtonManning`.
> - Continuous (e.g., change from baseline): direction depends on
>   the endpoint's clinical meaning — improvement could be a
>   higher or lower value. Ask the user.
>
> When in doubt, ask: "Higher values of this endpoint mean
> treatment is working — yes or no?"

For combination tests, graphical testing, group-sequential
boundaries, and other multiplicity procedures, see the
**"Testing and multiplicity"** section in `SKILL.md`. It covers when
to use the package's `dunnettTest` + `closedTest` (seamless /
dose-selection), the `GraphicalTesting` class, hierarchical and
Bonferroni alternatives, and when to fall back to `rpact` /
`gsDesign` for boundaries. Read the package's worked examples
(`?<class>` and the `adaptiveDesign` / `actionFunctions` vignettes)
before writing — the APIs are concrete and easier from a worked
example than from prose.

## Action-function utilities

| Function | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `expandRegimen(data)` | Expand the compact `regimen_trajectory` column in locked data into one row per regimen segment per patient (adds `regimen` and `switch_time_from_enrollment`; drops `regimen_trajectory`). Use **inside an action function** — typically right after `trial$get_locked_data(...)` — to make a switching trajectory readable for downstream computation. Only meaningful when treatment switching is enabled via `add_regimen`. |

## Post-simulation utilities

| Function | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `summarizeMilestoneTime(output)` | Summarize triggering times of all milestones across replicates. Returns a `data.frame` with a `plot` method. Input is `controller$get_output()`. **Precondition — call only when the design has NO binding early-stop rule.** A binding rule includes binding futility, binding efficacy at any milestone, arm-dropping in dose-selection / seamless designs, response-adaptive randomization, or any decision flag that, in a real trial, would change which subsequent milestones occur. Under any such rule, every replicate still runs through every milestone in the simulation (TS does not stop early), so the times this function reports describe *what would have happened if the trial ran to every milestone* — not the realized duration. **Do not call** in that case; compute expected duration post-hoc from saved decision flags (see "Trials never stop early in simulation" gotcha below). With non-binding futility (the trial is permitted to continue regardless of crossing) the function is appropriate; still label any plot/caption as "non-binding milestone times" so a reader cannot confuse them with a binding-aware expected duration. **Multi-scenario reports**: never include a single un-labeled milestone-time plot from one cherry-picked scenario. Either facet by scenario, overlay distributions with a legend, or replace the plot with a per-scenario timing column already in the OC table. |

## Non-obvious behaviors (gotchas)

These will bite you if you don't know them.

### Auto-saved milestone columns

Every triggered milestone — even with `action = doNothing` — auto-saves
the following into `controller$get_output()`:

| Column pattern | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `milestone_time_<name>` | Calendar time of the trigger |
| `n_events_<milestone>_<endpoint>` | Observed events (TTE) or non-missing readouts (non-TTE) |
| `n_events_<milestone>_<patient_id>` | Number of enrolled patients at the trigger |
| `n_events_<milestone>_<arms>` | data.frame column: per-arm event/sample counts |

**Do not redundantly save these manually.** Trial duration, event
counts, sample size by arm — already there. Access via
``out[["milestone_time_<final>"]]``,
``out[["n_events_<interim>_<os>"]]``.

`controller$get_output(tidy = TRUE)` drops these from the returned
data frame; use it when the auto-saved columns aren't needed for
reporting. **Caution:** if a custom `save()` name matches the regex
`^n_events_<.*?>_<.*?>$` or `^milestone_time_<.*?>$`, it gets dropped
too. Pick distinctive custom names.

Canonical reference: the "Automatically Saved Results At Triggered
Milestones" table in
https://zhangh12.github.io/TrialSimulator/articles/actionFunctions.html.

### Global dropout — no per-endpoint variation

`trial(dropout = ...)` accepts **one** dropout function. It runs once
per patient; the resulting dropout time censors every TTE endpoint
and zeroes out any non-TTE readouts whose readout-time exceeds it.
**There is no way to assign different dropout distributions or rates
to different endpoints**, and the package does not validate against
this confusion — silently mis-specifying it just won't fail.

When the user requests endpoint-specific dropout (e.g., "5%/year for
PFS, 2%/year for OS"), do not silently collapse to a single rate.
Surface the limitation: explain that TS uses one dropout time per
patient, ask the user which behavior they want, and offer the three
practical options:

1. **Use the most conservative single rate** across endpoints (most
   common choice; mildly overcensors the longer-tailed endpoint).
2. **Pick a clinically dominant endpoint** (e.g., the primary) and
   use its rate as the global rate; document the approximation.
3. **Use a custom dropout function** that draws a per-patient
   dropout time from a mixture or compound distribution that
   approximates the multi-endpoint behavior.

Get the user's choice on record before writing the script. The
parameter table's "Source / Notes" column should mark the resulting
global rate as `user (translated)` or `derived` with the rationale.

### `add_regimen` must precede `add_arms`

```r
tr <- trial(...)
tr$add_regimen(reg)              # MUST be before add_arms
tr$add_arms(sample_ratio, ...)   # errors otherwise
```

### `save_custom_data` namespace + `overwrite`

`save()` and `save_custom_data()` share a name registry. Calling both
with the same `name` errors with "X has been used to name something in
custom data." Use **distinct** names.

The custom-data registry persists across replicates (the value resets
between replicates, but the name doesn't). Without `overwrite = TRUE`,
replicate 2 errors on the duplicate name. **Always set
`overwrite = TRUE` on `save_custom_data()`.**

```r
trial$save_custom_data(value = best_arm, name = "selected", overwrite = TRUE)
trial$save(value = best_arm, name = "selected_arm")
```

When retrieving in a later milestone, guard against `NULL` (the
saving milestone may not have fired):

```r
selected <- trial$get(name = "selected")
if (is.null(selected)) selected <- "<fallback>"
```

### Trials never stop early in simulation

Every replicate runs through all milestones in chronological order,
regardless of any "stopping" rule. TrialSimulator does not bind a
stopping decision to the trial flow — that decision is post-hoc,
derived from rejection / decision flags the user saves at adaptive
milestones. This is intentional: one simulation can score multiple
stopping rules without re-running.

Implication: when the user asks for stopping-aware operating
characteristics, save the decision at each adaptive milestone and
derive the metrics in post-processing.

```r
# In the interim action: save the decision flag.
trial$save(value = as.integer(p_interim <= bound), name = "reject_interim")

# Post-simulation: derive actual stopping time and metrics.
stop_time <- ifelse(out$reject_interim == 1,
                    out[["milestone_time_<interim>"]],
                    out[["milestone_time_<final>"]])

mean(stop_time)               # expected duration accounting for early stopping
mean(out$reject_interim)      # early-stop probability for efficacy
```

`mean(out[["milestone_time_<final>"]])` alone reports the duration
*if every replicate ran to final* — fine for non-binding interim
reporting, misleading when early stopping binds. The same logic
applies to expected sample size, dose-selection timing, futility
stopping, and any other adaptation: save the decision flags
explicitly, then compose them in post-processing.

### `dunnettTest` formula must use `Surv(time, event) ~ arm`

For TTE endpoints. `time ~ arm` errors with "Response must be a
survival object." Same for any wrapper that expects a survival
formula. Skipping combination tests for now per the stub convention,
but note this when you do build it back in.

### Action function signature

Always `function(trial, ...)`. The `trial` is passed by the listener;
extra args (per-milestone configuration) come through `...` and are
specified as `milestone(name = ..., when = ..., action = my_action,
my_arg = value)`.
